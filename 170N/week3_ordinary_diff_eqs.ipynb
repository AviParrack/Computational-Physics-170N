    "So what is a module and how do you write one?  A Python **module** is a `.py` file that contains valid Python code.  Often that code includes functions that you plan to use often.  For example, if you're doing a lot of number theory and need to compute prime factorizations of numbers often, you could write a module called `numtheo.py` that contains a function called `prime_factor` which computes the prime factor of a given positive integer, and any time you want to use that function, you can just import the module as you'd import e.g. numpy by typing `import numtheo` and then you could call the function by typing `numtheo.prime_factor`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, you simply need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a `<your_last_name>.py` file in the directory where you plan to run your project notebook.  Putting the file in the same directory as the notebook where it will be used allow for easy importing of the module.  For example, I'd create a file called `alves.py`.\n",
    "1. Write your functions for all projects, including this one, in that module.  If your functions themselves rely on a package such as `numpy`, you will need to import those packages at the beginning of the module for those functions to work properly when your module is imported and used.\n",
    "1. Import the functions you've written into your notebook to perform your analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note.** If you want to write other functions in your module aside from those that you are asked to write in these project instructions, feel free to do so!  These could include functions that help you plot things easily for example, or \"helper\" functions that you use as building blocks for more complex functions.\n",
